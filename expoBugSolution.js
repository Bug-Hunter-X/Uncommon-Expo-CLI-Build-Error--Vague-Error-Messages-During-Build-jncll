The solution depends heavily on the exact root cause, which is difficult to diagnose from the vague error messages.  However, here's a structured approach to debugging and potential solutions:

1. **Examine the full error log**: Don't just look at the top-level message.  Examine the entire log output for clues, even warning messages.   The error might be caused by a seemingly unrelated issue earlier in the build process.
2. **Simplify your project**: Create a minimal reproducible example by removing as much code as possible, keeping only the essential parts needed to trigger the error.  This can help isolate the problem.
3. **Check native module dependencies**: If using native modules, ensure that they are correctly integrated and built. Check the native module's documentation for compatibility with your Expo SDK version and build process.
4. **Clean your build**: Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear any cached build artifacts.
5. **Update dependencies**: Make sure your Expo CLI and all packages are up to date. 
6. **Examine package.json**: Review the `package.json` file for any potential conflicts or issues in your dependencies.  Try running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.
7. **Test with a new project**: Create a new project using Expo CLI and compare it to your existing one.  This can help verify if the problem lies within your specific project or a configuration issue.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's say the vague error was linked to a faulty native module.  The solution might involve updating that module or adjusting its configuration.  This would need to be specific to the module used.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js (Illustrative)
// ... Code to fix the specific problem within the native module or dependency ...
