This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that uses a custom build system or has some complex dependencies.  The exact cause is difficult to pinpoint as it's often a downstream consequence of problems during the build process.  For example, a native module might not be built correctly, causing the Expo CLI to fail during the start or build command. This often presents as a generic error message, such as `Error: Command failed: ...` without much specific detail.
